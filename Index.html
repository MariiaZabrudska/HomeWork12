<p style="text-align:center;">As a child, I dreamed of a home zoo. I said: "When I grow up, I will have a separate room for animals." And so I grew up and have three pets.</p>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->

<p class="pets">Kitty Marusya is a Scottish fold breed. She has a calm, balanced character. However, she will not allow you to take her in your arms and stroke her. Only when she needs a favor, she herself will come to you. My husband made a wicker house for her and she sleeps in it while we watch TV, and at night she comes to sleep in our bed. When someone is sick, she always lies with him, treats him.</p>

<p class="pets">The Cerber dog is a half-breed Miniature Pinscher. This breed usually has cropped ears and a tail. But we didn't do that. He is very kind and incredibly active. And always hungry. You have to wear a muzzle for a walk, because he eats everything he finds on the street. He is a very good defender, feels bad people, alcoholics, drug addicts. He is an ideal service dog, amenable to training.</p>

<p class="pets">Richie's ring-necked parrot. Very noisy and restless. In five years of living with us, he never got used to the hands. He really doesn't like it when music or a movie is turned on loudly, or when someone quarrels. Outside the cage, he walks like a businessman, rolling from foot to foot. And the coloring makes his look as if he suspects everyone of something.</p>
